## Magnetic Hinges

These hinges are designed to go together with [quick-release panel latches].
They open 270Â° and leave just enough clearance around the latches. Plus, they
are magnetic, so they detach quickly.

Three options for printing:

- Print as-is to get a flat version without the logo
- Split into parts and delete the inlay to get a relief Voron logo
- Print the inlay in accent color to get a nice colorized Voron logo

### Known issues

- In the current version, the stem that goes into the extrusion is juuuust a bit
  too short, which causes the doors to slightly bind.
- Friction on the magnets can cause the coating to deteriorate. My solution was
  to add a layer of electrical tape.
